        <h1>Peppermint Tea</h1>
        <h4>Alex Papadopoulos</h4>

        <p>
            Peppermint tea reminds me of childhood sick days. <br>Curtains wide open, door half shut - blankets and cold showers.<br>
            A palm on my forehead, my mother's head peaking from the crevice. <br>
            Sweaty chest and white flannel - toasted bread and star soup. 
        </p>
        <p>Peppermint tea reminds me of cold nights.<br>
            Nightrobes and boardgames on the big, round, glass table. <br>
            A card game called "families" - <br>
            a lingering irony.</p>

        <p>Peppermint tea reminds me of growing.<br>
            Suitcases packed with tubes filled with it - <br>
            care packages arriving on the perfect moment. <br>
            Colorful cups and sleepless nights -<br>
            hungover mornings and <br>
            a wish for a remedy. </p>

        <p>A cup on my nightstand, I still wish for a remedy. </p>

        <p>A remedy for pain. </p>
        <p>A remedy for loss.</p>
        <p>My mother's soft hand on my forehead. </p>
